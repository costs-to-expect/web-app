# Costs to Expect - Web app

## Overview

What does it cost to raise a child in the UK?

Costs to Expect is a long-term project, my wife and I are tracking the expenses to raise our child to 
adulthood, 18.

### Why?

There are two core reasons as to why I/we are doing this. I love data, and over the last twenty years, 
it appears to have become accepted knowledge that it costs £250k to raise a child in the UK. 

If you think about the number, it becomes apparent quickly that it can't be right, on average over 
£10k a year?

This API will show the costs to raise my child; obviously, every family is different, these costs only 
relate to my family, more details will appear on https://www.costs-to-expect.com as the site develops.
